A grey-blue anteater who is one of the most intelligent characters in the series. He is the second character introduced without a heart-shaped nose and a pair of buckteeth (the other being Lumpy). He usually likes doing and reading science and math problems. To reinforce the 'nerd' image that Sniffles exudes, he is seen dressed up as Spock, a Star Trek character (the Vulcan ears being the giveaway), in Remains to be Seen and Something Fishy. He also sports a pair of glasses that are taped at the bridge and a pocket protector on his chest, even though he wears no clothes.

His mouth and nose are combined to make a trunk-like snout, with his lips at the tip. It used to be long in the earlier Internet episodes, but starting with the TV series, it became much shorter. The reason for this was to add additional cuteness to his appearance. Furthermore, although already depicted as such when he is facing the front, first seen in Wrath of Con and more prominently seen starting in Pet Peeve, his snout became slightly shorter and was made straight. Episodes such as Wrath of Con and I've Got You Under My Skin reveal that his ears sometimes move to match how he feels, like Cuddles' ears.
