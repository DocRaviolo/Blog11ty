# Character Bio

Lumpy is a light blue anthropomorphic moose (originally a dinosaur) with a low I.Q. (intelligence quotient), teeth that appear on his nose or mouth, weird eyes, and mismatched antlers. Instead of the normal small, plump body with a large, oval head, he is taller and skinnier than the other characters and has a smaller, narrower, elongated head. He is sometimes portrayed as the babysitter or caretaker for many of the other characters. He is also known to care for things other than his fellow tree friends, like his giant corn ear in Aw, Shucks! or his pet elephant in Junk in the Trunk. He usually means well and is nearly always kind and friendly. But most of the time he is clumsy and extremely unintelligent. His usual catchphrases are "Mmm-hmm!" when he thinks he has solved a problem or when he is satisfied and "Ah-ha!" when he gets an idea. He is one of the four primary characters as he appears in numerous advertisements.
